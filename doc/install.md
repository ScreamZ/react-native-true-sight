# Step 1 - Install library

Run either `npm i react-native-true-sight --save` or `yarn add react-native-true-sight`

# Step 2 - Install dependencies

This library best fit with [React Native Video](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-video) and has a required dependency with [React Native Slider](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-slider).

As in V2 everything is thinking modular, you can use other library but you'll need it for the default components.

Please be sure to follow the doc in order to set-up those correctly.

**Now you're ready to go!**
